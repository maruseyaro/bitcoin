We'd like to see if you can create your own simple web app using:

- React
- Redux
- Styled components (show the use of some props)
- React re-charts ( http://recharts.org/en-US/ )

The web app should graph the BCH price from:

https://index-api.bitcoin.com/api/v0/cash/price/us
see api endpoints in docs
The web app should include the latest 4 news posts from the following endpoint:

https://news.bitcoin.com/feed/

(You may require a CORS proxy)

Below the graph should be three buttons to switch graph views from:

24 hour / 7 days / 1 month

The web app should also feature the current price of BCH.
